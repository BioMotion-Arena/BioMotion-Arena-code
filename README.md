This repository is intended solely for data-case demonstration during the anonymous review phase. Please do not distribute or share its contents.

The **generated_data** folder contains code produced by large models for rendering different categories of biological motions.

gpt.py is a demo prompt script that instructs the model to generate rendering code for a specified biological motion target.
